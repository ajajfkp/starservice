					<h3>Hello!</h3>
				</div>

				<p class="lead">As a college student I always struggled with purchasing expensive textbooks from the college store. On the other hand, an online store was a bit cheaper but it was extremely inconvenient having to wait. Shipping took days and the option of expedited shipping had extra fees.</p>

				<p class="lead">At the same time, I noticed that a lot of students from my school(s) were trying to sell books much cheaper that I was eager to purchase and there were plenty of students who wanted to buy books that I wanted to sell.</p>

				<p class="lead">The aha moment: What if there is a way to connect student buyers to a student sellers from the <strong>same schools</strong> ? What if shipping and handling could be eliminated by delivering books at the campus? What if there is a way that students can find out about these options in one dedicated website? That’s when college books ‘r’ us idea was born.</p>
				
				<p class="lead">Fast forward few years later. In 2015, I met Arman and Gokul. After sharing my ideas to them the three of us decided to become business partners and that’s when <a href="www.collegebooksrus.com"><strong>www.collegebooksrus.com</strong></a> was founded.</p>
